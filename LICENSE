**Definition and the Four Freedoms**
Freedom 0: The freedom to run the program for any purpose.
Freedom 1: The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.
Freedom 2: The freedom to redistribute and make copies so you can help your neighbor.
Freedom 3: The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that 
the whole community benefits.

**N.B:** Access to source code is a necessary but insufficient condition, according to both the Free Software and Open Source definitions.

The Python Software Foundation License (PSFL) is a BSD-style, permissive free software license which is compatible with the GNU General 
Public License (GPL).[1] Its primary use is for distribution of the Python project software. Unlike the GPL the Python license is not a 
copyleft license, and allows modified versions to be distributed without source code. The PSFL is listed as approved on both FSF's 
approved licenses list,[1] and OSI's approved licenses list.


Earlier versions of Python were under the Python License, which is incompatible with the GPL. The reason given for this incompatibility 
by Free Software Foundation was that "this Python license is governed by the laws of the 'State of Virginia', in the USA", and the GPL 
does not permit this.[2]

The year that Python's creator Guido van Rossum changed the license to fix this incompatibility, he was awarded the Free Software 
Foundation Award for the Advancement of Free Software.[3]
